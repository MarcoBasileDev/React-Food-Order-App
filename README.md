This project is a React application designed to serve as a food ordering platform. It consolidates various React concepts and techniques, including HTTP requests, custom components and hooks, context and reducers, modals, user input handling, and HTTP loading/error state management.

## Learning Goals

This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience for consolidating knowledge and skills in React, including:

- Fetching data from a backend using HTTP requests.
- Creating reusable custom components and hooks.
- Managing state with useContext and reducers.
- Implementing modals for user interaction.
- Effectively handling user input and form submission.
- Handling loading and error states for HTTP requests.

## Features

**View Meals:** The app fetches meal data from the backend via HTTP requests, allowing users to view available meals.
Add to Cart: Users can add food products to their cart directly from the app interface.
**Cart Management:** The cart functionality includes a modal where users can adjust the quantity of items and remove them from the cart.
**Checkout:** After adding desired items to the cart, users can proceed to checkout by providing their personal information.
**HTTP Loading and Error Handling:** The app effectively manages loading states and error handling for HTTP requests.
